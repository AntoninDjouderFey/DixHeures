As I said in the short description, it is a 3rd year school project from the java moudle.

Objectives:
Using data from [Spotify Million Song Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset?resource=download), the goal was to build an app that can simulate a music streaming platform. Hence the name "DixHeures" (sounds like Deezer in French). Users (only over 18) should be able to create/delete an account, add/delete friends, create a "family" (where they can add under 18 users). Once logged in, they can create/delete/edit playlists/blindtests. And they can play songs/blindtests/playlists. They can also recommend songs to their friends/family.
